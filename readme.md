## Introducing

*The Most Dangerous Writing App* is designed to get you into a state of flow. If you stop typing for more than five seconds, all progress will be lost.

Set a time goal before you start writing, such as five minutes, which means that you must keep typing for the next five minutes. If you stop for more than five seconds, everything you have written before will disappear. After five minutes, what you wrote before will be retained.
